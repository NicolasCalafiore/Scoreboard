Objective:
This Project I made to have a simple sports scoreboard for personal activities

Functions:
   - Easily and quickly keep track of scores of two opposing sports teams
   - Add or subtract scores

Notes:
- This program was originally intended to be used on my touchscreen laptop
- At the top of the screen the "records" button is inoperable. This was I featured I planned to implement but never got to.

Date:
circa. Mid 2019 .

This project was created around 2019 and will not be updated.
